# The Idea

## Context
There are various different sources where you get your information from.
- Instagram, where you like to follow your artists
- YouTube or Reddit, tech experts showcasing products or showing their own projects
- (Free source) articles talking and discussing about politics or newest tech.
- Other Internet sources / apps with their own flavor like Blue sky, Tumblr

## Problem
- Too many apps
- I only use one app per "Phase". During that phase I use a few apps but not all, information that I am interested in get lost. There is no Routine.
- The source of information is controlled by single Entities / Algorithms, ex. Instagram -> Meta
- less known apps or information sources with specific topics are easily ignored (by me, an ADHD guy)

## Solution
Develop an App that connects to your various Internet accounts. Unify your daily source of information in one App!

It is also a possibility to push less known / used sources to the mainstream!
