# Summary
- Create Objects like mentioned in [[Create new Objects]]
- The best way to store data:
	- ScriptableObjects: Easily Editable in the Editor. Note: When Using an (public attribute) Array of Other Objects (Like Cube) and adding an object through the "+" Symbol, it will probably generate new Object through the whole list. I noticed that because when I added something, the readonly attribute "id" from cube was set to 0, since the system can't just copy paste the previous values like with other attributes. I guess that is an typical Array issue.
	- Json: Human Readable Files, more control what goes in and out. Little bit harder to edit. Maybe easier with an external tool? It is useful for raw data but I when it comes to init a private id, it won't be possible.
