| What is a witch? | A witch is granted certain powers when proven worthy by the gods. So the power she posseses is temporary and not hers. The ability and skills on *how* to use the gifted power is her own, however. | A witch is a person from outside the dream of modern society. They normally bring change and chaos due to their unfamiliar characteristics | In this world, a "**witch**-beast" is infected by a certain disease / virus that somehow mutates specific body parts.

## Zitate
> I have a pain in my chest. A burning fire in my bewitched heart that just seems to be coming out of nowhere without a warning. When I was dancing there, it still hurt. It summoned thoughts and perspectives off the world and my life I never had before. I let that fire overcome the rest of my body. Now everything about me seems to burn but it was less of a pain. I felt free. I never wanted to stop dancing. The sharp stones beneath my feet felt better than the pain I had in my heart. So I danced and danced, danced like I am a flame fighting against the wind. Once I stopped letting the pain dictate me, I screamed. I screamed all my air out above to the sky like I was able to curse the gods and the world. I was in sync with every element surrounding me. They were controlling me and the other way around.
