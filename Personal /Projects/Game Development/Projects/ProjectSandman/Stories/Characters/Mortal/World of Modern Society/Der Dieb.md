# Steckbrief 

## Zitate
> I don't want to make people feel uncomfortable around me. But too many times did I make myself little for authorities like my boss and teacher so they can tell me what to do or think. Talk to me the way *they* think is okay. Too many times did I let other people put me inside their little jokes so they stay relevant in the group. I was told I am too loud, too much.
> Well, if my mere existence and voice is an inconvenience to you, that is too bad. And I feel very comfortable letting my legs lay on the table. I want to say what I think. I want to tell people to "back off" when they try to invade *my* comfort zone. I want to argument with them, have a fight just to get my point across even if it is just for the sake of fighting. I want to use my power for exactly that. I don't think I ever want to change that.

> People like it simple. So keep it simple.
