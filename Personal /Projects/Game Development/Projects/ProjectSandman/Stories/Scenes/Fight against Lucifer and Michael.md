Usage of the spell: Memento Mori (Erinnere dich an deine Sterblichkeit). Casting that spell summons the essence of death in a given space. Can be used to rip off someones immortatility.

# Practice
Lucifer uses that spell. It summons a bubble / space where time seems to freeze. They fight until the end. But however it ends, they will both perish (? Kinds sounds boring). Both Michael and Lucifers lifespan reach 1 second before their final fate. This second is freezed for an undefined amount of time. As soon as the bubble burst, time goes on and so the last second.

After the burst of the bubble, they fall to dust (? Or die, or one of them die, or the winner, or what DOES actually happen? Can michael win and get out of the bubble alive but with consequences?), the marmor ground turned to stone (?   How does marmor age?)
