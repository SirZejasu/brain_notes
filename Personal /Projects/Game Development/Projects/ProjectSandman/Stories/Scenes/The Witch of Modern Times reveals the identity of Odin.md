[[The Witch of Modern Times]] learned a spell to reveal ones other (! not true, because the truth is always complicated and matter of subjective opinion) identity. After she has doubts in the [[Odin |chief]] / mayor / president of the fraktion / city / guild, she *dares* to use her newly learned spell against him, revealing him of his other (! not true) identity. A magic stealing priest, using "religion" as a tool and who's goal is to "Rationalize" society, ban "spirituality" and create a world of perfect order. He has the opinion that religion disrupts that order.

This results in physical conflict.

The Witch regrets her action for a short time and flees (? Or fights)

# The Fight
To get her point through, she represents herself as "The priestess" and sheds her power given by the gods to fight against the "Priest" / Odin / Mayor, who uses its full power he gathered / stole over time. He does that to prove the point that "power is everything (to bring final peace to the world)" (Sounds basic, we can do better than that, He sounds like a Faschist who wants to do "good" in the world, in his opinion at least)

Her point is to tell that religion is something personal that should not be used as a political tool or should be diminished as something that can not exists in modern society. She brings her first point to the front by "removing" her gifted power and uses her basic skills (that SHE owns and learned through her adventures) to fight against the Priest.
