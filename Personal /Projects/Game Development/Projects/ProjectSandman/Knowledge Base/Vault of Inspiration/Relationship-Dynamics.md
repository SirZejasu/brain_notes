# Strong Man, Strong Woman
Sounds cheesy / cringy but hear me out.

Men are still seen to this day as the dominant part of the relationship in "Mainstream"-Media. Maybe this is my personal old pov. There are still powerdynamics like Captain America and Agent Carter, Black Widow and the Archer guy (not romantic, but still a power dynamic)

The point is, that a Person that has "the world on their shoulder" might need the help of another person with the same struggles and strength to cope with it. Just to make eveything a little easier.

## Inspiration
"You say you want a stronger version of me"
- Man has a lot of "mainstream"-relationships, stereotypical Barbie girlfriends until he meets someone who gets a more intimate relationship, someone who is more than "a pretty girl" but someone who understands his struggles because he/she/they go through the same and can easily relate to it.

# Intimacy between men
Focus on gay men. Why?
Because in modern day, you have Grindr, Romeo, the Gay sauna an other Spots / Places to have intercourse (sexual or not) 

**Question**: Can you have an *intimate* relationship without sex?
