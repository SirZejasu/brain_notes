The influence of [[Mutter|The Goddess]] seems to be everywhere. It is hard to see that there is another, equal power in play in the universe, [[Vater|The God]], when she is the one who is literally "pulling the strings (of fate)". She brings order and calm, determinism and thus development, progression. She is fate. Fate and determinism, a script of life from the beginning of everything to the End of all that everyone and everything follows. Every step, every decision you did is actually contributed to her. 
For many, this brings comfort to many, almost everyone. Why? Because it means that there is a future that can be forseen for whatever comes. Comfort of Certainty. However you feel about this idea, you can't ignore her presence.
For she is Death, the only true constant in the universe that will not change in any timeline. Even Eternity has an End.

But this is not entirely true.

The God is the part of the universe that no one can fully comprehend for he is infinite. He is Chaos Incarnate. An influence that lives in any of us (and things) in many primal Forms: Emotions like anger and joy or some form of "primal force". He is what makes us alive but only if you care to listen. Sometimes, he can be the voice inside that appears and you try to shake it off. Sometimes it disappears through enough effort, but in other times this voice grows. When it was just a sapling at the beginning, it now grew roots in your heart and mind. Trying to ignore that voice will cause Storms of thoughts, a firey burn that overcomes you, a storm that cant be ignored. An echo that halls through every part of your body that only stops until you do an action that satisfies these emotions and burning desire.
This primal force is forcing people to be creative in order to survive. This is the same force that create art, like music, imagery etc. 
He is Life. Similar like Life disappeared and appeared as something else through time, he is a cosmic fire that can be extinguished but will *always* come back as something else.

Some of these versions of him gain memories of his past *or* future selves. The Future selves are the biggest threats to The Goddess, since she does not know how to handle things that do not exist yet -> Science/Determinism can only prove something that exist, never something that does not exist.

He is the change, the opposition and the grand challenger of her, The Goddess. For when she brings Order, he breaks it. For when she says It must so, he says it does not have to.

The results of these two Entites create one last primal Entity: The Child God. 
He is the Incarnation of Magic, the fabric that connects the universe together. They appear when the two forces, The God and the Goddess, are forcing the universe to break apart.
He is something new.
Note to self: Sounds like he is just a version of The God. Define more.

    > This heavely sounds like the warped mindset that creating a child would solve any problem, I have to be careful with that.

| What does the Child also represent? | The conscious universe, [[Wald der Schöpfung\|The Forest]] and the inhabitants themselves (expect [[Gods\|The Aspects]]) are the child itself. So if it is being threatened, it awakens to defend themselve.<br><br>Note to self: Sounds better! |     |
