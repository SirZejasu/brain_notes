Humanss seek the primal
Seek the beginning, and thus the meaning of the beginning

By searching, thy see the reality as what it is

but not at what it is originally meant to be

they fear to be judged, always

because being human means to be not being alone. Being alone means the end, Death.

What we know, is that we are the only intellignt, conscious being in the universe. 
It's uncomfortable because it means we are alone. 
Alone with our problems. No Gods to elavate us with their divine wisdom.

We ARE ALONE.

JUST US.

my thoughts are everywhere. yet I m silent about the things I know because they make no sense

humans are not divided

the god we seek, is the god we are ourself.
we control everything.
yet, we are divided.
