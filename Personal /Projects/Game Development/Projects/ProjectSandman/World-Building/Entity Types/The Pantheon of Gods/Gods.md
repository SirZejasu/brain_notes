# About
The pantheon of Gods are aspects of the [[Vater|Father]] and the [[Mutter|Mother]]. 
The Aspect present the father, the mother or both.
Mortals, intelligent life or not, are aspects of the [[Kind|Child]], They **cant** ascend to Godhood!

The Gods have the ability to change certain aspects of reality around them.
They are also immortal, which means they cant be "easily" removed by the Mother (Death). This is a nuance for the great Architect, since these Gods are able to control the fate of the world without the influence of Death.

## Rules / Ideas
1. Gods are not able to leave the Realm they are born in.
2.  Being a God means to have power, rather than purpose.
3. Immortality grants them immunity from death.

> [!NOTE]
    > The Gods that purely represent an aspect of the Chaos-God are seen as anomalies by the Mother. She will not intervene to "remove" them, as long as "the system works".
    > Gods that purely or partly represent her aspects are created by her at will and serve a function in her eyes.

> [!question]
    > Was [[Lucifer]] an aspect of the Chaos-God that was then manipulated by the Mother, inheriting thus an aspect of the mother?
