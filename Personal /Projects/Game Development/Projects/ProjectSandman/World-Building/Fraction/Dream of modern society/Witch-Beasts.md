# About
Becoming a witch-beast is like confronting with the symptoms and consequences of having any kind of disease: Weaker body through aging or cancer, Immunesystem failure through AIDS or allergies. Or autistic "diseases" like Autism or ADHD. It is the fear of change of your own body or just being different than others. It is the fear that your body is depended on all it's functions. Where all of your organs have to work in synch in order to keep you alive.
But being a Witch-Beast also means to overcome these weaknesses and pain (Mentally or physically) and gain strength / power from it (or somewhere else if a Witch-Beast has no granted power at all, maybe a source of power that has been there before the outbreak, like social relationships, skills, magic practice etc.), even if it hurts. 
The stories of witch-beasts are about adapting, sacrifcing and celebrating life even though Life (The chaotic influence of [[Vater|Life]]) itself throws all the horrors at you.

Witch-Beasts are infected by a disease / virus. When infected, it forces mutations of the body with unforseen results. Every virus-outbreak is individual. Some of them also develop supernatural powers like telekinesis, talking to ghosts and casting spells to gestures or words.

I want to create a different name for it. For now, I will use the word for "Witch" and "Beast" to describe it's main characteristics
**Witch**: Deeper connection to the supernatural and natural, an individual feared but also somehow fascinated and maybe respected through their wisdom and power, like ancient Witches / Priests in Indo-european cultures before christianity.
**Beasts**: This is more about the phyiscal Traits. Body parts that are less human, more animalistic or neither.

In the story, the disease is being treated like a pandemic but it has more similarities with mental issues. Mental Health and physical are actually treated and seen differently. I want to use the perspective of "physial diseases"
# Risk-Groups
The Virus that creates "Witch-Beasts" doesn't seem to infect everyone. Everyone can carry it but it only "bursts out" under certain circumstances.

## Characteristics of patients before becoming Witch-Beasts
The most common trait between those who are infected is that they are stuck between things after short period of time, vaguely speaking. Things of extreme opposites. It seems like the disease wants to somehow build a bridge between those things in it's own, macabre and twisted way.
As a reference from irl:
Social Extremes
- Friends who are politically left, family who tends to be more conservatives
- Generally speaking, when it comes to politics, everyone seems to have their own opinions. The sense of community drifts off, social bubbles.
- Born in poor circumstances now getting access to luxury
- Work-Life-Balance
- Hatred and Love
- Life and Death -> [[Life-Death-Witch]]
- Good and Bad -> Moral conflicts, [[The Witch of Modern Times]]
- Ecstacy / Depression -> Use of Drugs, Spikes of Emotions
- Presentation / Loss of Identity -> [[Der Dieb|The Thief]], stealing Identites (?)
- Imagination and Reality -> Trauma healing, [[Phantom-Personality]]
- Extreme indecesiveness
# Autonomy / Biology / Characteristics
The infected individual is developing mutated Organs or Limps. It could be anything: Heart, Brain, the Skin, Only one arm or both.
Most of the time the disease stops spreading on it's own and stabilizes itself, others get unlucky and the disease spreads all over the body, causing critical changes that can lead to torturing pain and / or death.
Either way, somehow, the infected have a (deeper )connection to magic and develop supernatural abilities.

# Other Common things
Mortals generally are an aspect of the [[Kind|Child]]. Witches are deeper connected to Magic (Or have a different form of connection to Magic).

# Story / Origin
⚠️Spoiler ⚠️
The outbreak of the disease happend around the death of [[Odin]].
After his organs decayed one by one, the disease started to spread among the living. 
The outbreak is more or less "aggressive" because the power and "energy" that was actually "meant" to be in other places now tries to find a way back into reality / the ecosystem. Finding and "infecting" anything in their path. It spread like a giant bomb (metaphorically speaking)
