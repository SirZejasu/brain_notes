# Genre
Sandbox, Survival, RPG

# Sandbox / Survival
World is made of cubes or something that makes it somewhat inversive like Minecraft. Other similar Sandbox games are "No Mans Sky" but I dont like its execution in that regard. 

# RPG
✨Individualism ✨
# Combat-System
The base is the following: Characters and players have several skill tress at their disposal that define "base"-classes.
They each have their distinguishable features / Bonis. The Player can chose which perks fits for them best for roleplaying purposes. (Two-class system like in DND?)
NO weapon is restricted, they can use anything they can adapt their skill with it

## Skill-Trees
Player can chose from the following trees.
Depending on which one (or two, relatively) Tree-Skill they have advanced, the player will be automatically, passicely assigned a "Class" that helps the NPC / AI how to perceive the player.
Examples:
Only Magic Tree will result the player as seen as "Magician"
If the magic tree and physical tree are somewhat equal, the player will be seen as something like "Magician who also likes to kick butts when their mana runs out"
Makes it interesting for conversations :)
