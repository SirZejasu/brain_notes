# Idea
An idea I found somewhere on the internet. 
Additionally. I want to use it as an auto-backup 
Backup:
- Local and Cloud-Storage. Cloud-Storage makes more sense to have a long-term backup for the most important stuff (Photos, Obsidian)

## Information to be displayed
My finances?
Was soll ich einkaufen?
Next personal project?
# Supplies
## Hardware
- A mirror (wow)
- Touch-Display
- Raspberry-PI
- Vielleicht USB- Verlängerungskabel
- A camera (? seems extra)

## Software
- OS: ?
- App: App that connects with the Smart-mirror to determine what to display
- Backup-Software

## Backup-Software
I want to code it myself. Why not using Third-Party Software? Because I can and I want to and it's good to know what your program does.

# Cost
