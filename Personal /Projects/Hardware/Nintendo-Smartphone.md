# Explain the Idea
Inspired By this [Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy_9w_c2ub0)
Different than him, I want to create a Phone, that can also be used as a gaming console.

It can be used as a normal Smartphone.
When opened, it is basically an "advanced" Nintendo Console.

# Hardware
- Smartphone Devices.

# Software
OS: Linux

# Cost
Gonna be expensive probably :

# Issues to consider
Heat. Displays auf Voder- und Rückseite.
