#Dreamverse 



Marvel Comic Ideas

- Male Scarlet Witch from Reality 0 (Not a Wanda Variant, just somehow inherit the power of chaos magic)
- Codename: Ramuh
- More of a goofy character.
- Uses his Power to rewrite Reality and changes the way of Comic Telling (Random Panels, like from regular to 20s cartoons)
- "I want a new way of storytelling. I want more chaos. Let this reality be reborn. Let order be no more. Let there be a RENAISSANCE OF CHAOS."
- Got style B)
- "Stealing" a universe and traps Wanda and all the other powerful magic users insight a magic cage with runes (No magic inside can effect the outside world. Only inside. Cage cannot be broken).

Abilities: Reality Warping, Multiplying himself (With this spell, he was able to trap the magic users simultaneously).

#### Scene Ideas
*An Avenger approaching the magical cage*
Avenger: ... Wanda? Is that you?
*Scene switches to the view of the Avenger, seeing Wanda enjoying a cocktail on a beach with Vision*
Wanda: Oh, hello there. Are you here to help me out here?
Avenger: You dont look like you NEED any help. While this Red Maniac is running out there, manipulating, bending and twisting the fabric of reality you sitting here like your are on a vacation!
Wanda: A much needed one. *slurps from cocktail* Besides, see those runes? *shows the runes on the cage bars* They prevent me to break this cage and cast spells that effect the outside world.
Avenger: I see... sorry.
Wanda: He also doesnt seem to be the destructive personality. He is just playful. We just need to be patient, as simple as it sounds. Sooner or later, higher powers will notice his... manipulation of reality and interfere. 
But as long as long as I am trapped in this cage, there is nothing I can do. 
Avenger: ... you enjoy this, do you?
Wanda: Why shouldnt I? He isnt really life threatning. So I can just sit back and relax for a while until things have sort out by itself.
**Conversation continues. Wanda gives the Avenger a hint of a mythical, magical source in this Reality that might help to stop Ramuh (If it even exists)
