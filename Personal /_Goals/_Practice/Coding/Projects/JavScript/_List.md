In this [John Smilga tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=421s), you will learn how to create a random background color changer. This is a good project to get you started working with the DOM.

In [Leonardo Maldonado's article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/whats-the-document-object-model-and-why-you-should-know-how-to-use-it-1a2d0bc5429d/#:~:text=Advantages,the%20page%20without%20a%20refresh.) on why it is important to learn about the DOM, he states:

> By manipulating the DOM, you have infinite possibilities. You can create applications that update the data of the page without needing a refresh. Also, you can create applications that are customizable by the user and then change the layout of the page without a refresh.

Key concepts covered:

-   arrays
-   document.getElementById()
-   document.querySelector()
-   addEventListener()
-   document.body.style.backgroundColor
-   Math.floor()
-   Math.random()
-   array.length

Before you get started, I would suggest watching the [introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=0s) where John goes over how to access the setup files for all of his projects.
